Run the App
-----------

Congratulations!!!

Now you have almost completed the tutorial and written a simple Akka application. If you have not looked
at the full sample then now is a good time to do so.

- Java version: <a href="#code/src/main/java/HelloAkkaJava.java" class="shortcut">HelloAkkaJava.java</a>
- Scala version: <a href="#code/src/main/scala/HelloAkkaScala.scala" class="shortcut">HelloAkkaScala.scala</a>

Let's have some fun and run it.

In <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>, select the application to run from the drop-down list, and select
**Start**. Feel free to modify, compile and re-run the sample.

Inspect the App
---------------

Use <a href="#inspect" class="shortcut">Inspect</a> to see what is happening with the Actors in a running application.  This will contain a list of the Actors in the Actor System.  Drilling down into an individual Actor will display a number of statistics and information about the Actor.  Deviations will show you any issues with your Actors.
